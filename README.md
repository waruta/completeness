🧵 Continuous Toolpath Generator for Lattice Structures
This open-source Grasshopper script enables the generation of continuous, user-defined toolpaths for lattice structures specifically designed for extrusion-based pellet 3D printing. It empowers researchers, students, and artists to explore scalable additive manufacturing techniques without relying on SLA or SLS technologies.

By emphasizing continuity in toolpaths, this approach reduces retraction and support material, enabling more efficient, sustainable, and large-scale fabrication workflows.
